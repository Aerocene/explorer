# Aerocene Explorer
The Aerocene Explorer is your personal tool for solar-powered atmospheric exploration: a tethered-flight starter kit offering a new way to sense the environment and capture the world around you. Enclosed in a portable backpack is everything you need to float an Explorer sculpture and start exploring the skies. The sculpture floats without burning fossil fuels, helium, and other rare gases. Inflated only by air, lifted only by the sun, carried only by the wind, towards a clean and sustainable future. See http://aerocene.org/#explorer-beta-section

# What's in this repo
"How to float: an instruction manual" is named `170104__MANUAL_cc.pdf` and is located at the top-level of this repo.  

There are also two folders, one for making the solar balloon, and another for the sensor pack's hardware, software, and instructions.
